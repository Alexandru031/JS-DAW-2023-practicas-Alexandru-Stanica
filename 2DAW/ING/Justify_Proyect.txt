My Ionic development project consist in create a mobile application for 
rentals motorbike where they allow a user to use the vehicle temporarily.
Those who own the vehicle, they will be able to put prices depending on 
user needs of use. For example, a persona that need a motorbike in 1 month
or 1 week. This person need driving license, DNI, it's over 21 years old,
credit card and vehicle insurance to rent a motorbike.

Most people need this application in case that they don't have a vehicle or
the vehicle repairing or spoiled.

Additionally, they are economical vehicles that they don't requiered much
repair and maintenance to use.
